## 🚀 **Quick Start Guide**

### **Prerequisites**
- **Python 3.8 or higher** (3.9+ recommended, 3.13 supported)
- **pip package manager** (usually comes with Python)
- **Web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)

### **Python Version Compatibility**
- **Python 3.8-3.12**: Use `requirements.txt` (includes TensorFlow/PyTorch)
- **Python 3.13+**: Use `requirements-python313.txt` (TensorFlow/PyTorch alternatives)

### **What You'll Need to Know:**
- Basic understanding of cybersecurity concepts
- Familiarity with Python (helpful but not required)
- Interest in healthcare technology and digital twins

### **Installation Options**

#### **Option 1: Full Installation (Recommended for Students)**
```bash
# For Python 3.8-3.12 (includes TensorFlow/PyTorch)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# For Python 3.13+ (TensorFlow/PyTorch alternatives)
pip install -r requirements-python313.txt
```
*This gives you access to all features and machine learning capabilities.*

#### **Option 2: Minimal Installation (If you encounter dependency issues)**
```bash
# Install core dependencies only
pip install -r requirements-minimal.txt
```
*Use this if you have limited system resources or encounter installation problems.*

#### **Option 3: Virtual Environment (Recommended for isolation)**
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*This keeps the simulation separate from other Python projects on your computer.*

### **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

#### **Python Version Issues**
If you encounter Python version compatibility errors:
1. Use Python 3.8-3.11 (3.9+ recommended)
2. Try the minimal requirements: `pip install -r requirements-minimal.txt`
3. Update pip: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`

#### **Package Installation Issues**
If specific packages fail to install:
1. Install system dependencies first (on Linux):
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install python3-dev build-essential
   ```
2. Try installing packages individually:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn streamlit
   ```

#### **ML Library Issues**
If TensorFlow/PyTorch installation fails:
1. Use the minimal requirements file
2. For Python 3.13+, use the Python 3.13 requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-python313.txt
   ```
3. Install CPU-only versions (for Python 3.8-3.12):
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow-cpu
   # or
   pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
   ```

#### **Streamlit Issues**
If the dashboard doesn't load:
1. Make sure Streamlit is installed: `pip install streamlit`
2. Check if port 8501 is available
3. Try a different port: `streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502`
